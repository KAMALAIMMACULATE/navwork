<!-- <p class="para">Almost two million animals move across the Serengeti and Mara plains in search of food and water. Facing multiple dangers such as land predators and crocodiles the wildebeest complete an 800 km round trip during the migration.
The herds move from the southern plains of the Serengeti, through the western section into the Masai Mara in Kenya where they roam for a few months before heading south into the Serengeti again. But where does the migration start and where does it end? This is a bit like the chicken and the egg argument as the great migration is a continuous movement of animals throughout the year.
If pushed the answer would probably be that the Great Wildebeest Migration starts in the southern plains of the Serengeti as this is where the females give birth and also where the herds spend more time than anywhere else.</p>

<p class="para2">And every one of the ornaments has a special meaning. A house ornament symbolizes family shelter and protection. A bird ornament reflects happiness and joy. A heart ornament means there's true love in the home.The beaded ornaments represent Maasai cultural values and traditions. The practice is done specifically by women, and it's considered their duty to learn beadwork. These products are for both men and women, and they're used in cultural practices such as weddings, rituals, and community events</p>

      <p>The “Big Five” is a term that is used to refer to the 5 African animals that early big game hunters considered most difficult and dangerous animals to hunt on foot in Africa. These animals include the African elephant, lion, leopard, Cape buffalo, and rhinoceros.</p>

  	<h2>LION</h2>
    <img src="images/lio.jpg"style="width:95%" height="400">
    <p>The lion is often called the king of the jungle because <br>it is the fiercest and largest predator on land. Lion’s<br> natural prey includes zebras, impalas, giraffes <br>and other herbivores especially the wildebeest. Lions tend to group<br> themselves in pride of 12. Males are easily distinguished<br> from females with their shaggy manes and are generally much<br> larger. The females, however, do most of the hunting.<br> Although they have been known to attack humans, lions are <br>generally calm animals that do not usually seem threatened by close proximity to people.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
  	<h2>LEOPARD</h2>
    <img src="images/leo.jpg"style="width:95%" height="400">
    <p>Unlike the lions, leopards are almost always found alone. <br>They are the most elusive of the big five since they <br>mostly hunt during the night. The best time to find them is <br>very early in the morning or at night. During the day you <br>need to look carefully for these animals who usually can be found<br> partially camouflaged in the undergrowth or behind a tree</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
  	<h2>RHINO</h2>
    <img src="images/rino.jpg"style="width:95%" height="400">
    <p>Rhinoceros are an endangered species. Even seeing one at a <br>distance is a rare treat. There are two types of rhinos:<br> the black and white rhinos. The white rhino gets its name not from <br>its colour which is really more yellowish grey<br> but from the Dutch word “weid” which means wide. This is in reference <br>to the animal’s broad, wide mouth. With its square jaw<br> and wide lips, they are able to graze. The black rhino, <br>on the other hand, has a more pointed mouth which it uses to eat leaves from trees and bushes. <br>White rhinos are much larger than the black rhinos and more common</p>

  	<h2>BUFFALO</h2>
    <img src="images/buf.jpg"style="width:95%" height="400">
    <p>The buffalo is perhaps the most dangerous to humans among the big five.<br> Buffalos are very protective and territorial<br> and when threatened they are known to charge with astonishing speed. <br>The buffalo are mostly found in groups and large herds.<br> They spend most of their times grazing the savanna and floodplains.<br> When approached the dominant bulls will tend to take an <br>aggressive vigilant stand while the other adults gather around the calves to protect them</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
  	<h2>ELEPHANT</h2>
    <img src="images/elep.jpg"style="width:95%" height="400">
    <p>This is the largest land animal in the world. Some of the adults can reach <br>up to 3 meters in height. The adult males, bull elephants,<br> are usually solitary creatures while females are generally found in groups led<br> by a matriarch surrounded by younger females and their offspring. <br>Although they are referred by many as gentle giants, elephants can be very dangerous <br>and have been known to charge at vehicles, humans and other animals when they feel threatened</p>
